title: Getting JavaScript IntelliSense in MVC Razor Views
---
<p>A while ago, I posted about Getting IntelliSense working in ASP.NET MVC 3.&#160; Since the release MVC 3, the primary view engine has changed to Razor, and the previous technique isn’t as elegant.</p>  <p>With that in mind, I searched for a slightly prettier way to get IntelliSense working in Razor views.&#160; I was, unfortunately, unable to get the scripts to be referenced in the views <em>automatically</em>, but I think that this way is clean enough.</p>  <p>I used a <code>@section</code> directive to scoop out a part of the page during rendering, in order to prevent the “vsdoc” scripts files from being rendered to the final output. Here is how it looks in action:</p>  <p><img title="Razor Intellisense - 1 - Working" alt="Razor Intellisense - 1 - Working" src="/images/posts/Razor%20Intellisense%20-%201%20-%20Working.png" /></p>  <p>But now we have a couple of challenges to deal with. If we just ignore the section, we get this:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>The following sections have been defined but have not been rendered for the layout page &quot;~/Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml&quot;: &quot;intellisense&quot;.</p> </blockquote>  <p>And we know that we don’t want to render it to the final output, so we have to come up with a way to trick the Razor engine into thinking that we did, in fact, render the output.</p>  <p>My first attempt at solving this was to put this into the _Layout.cshtml page:</p>  <pre class="brush: html; toolbar: false; auto-links: false;">@{RenderSection(&quot;intellisense&quot;, required: false);}</pre>

<p>But that was not enough to trick the view engine. Apparently, you have to actually <em>render</em> the section <em>somewhere</em> in order for it to be considered “rendered”. Luckily, we can just render it to a throw-away StringWriter, like so:</p>

<pre class="brush: html; toolbar: false; auto-links: false;">@{WriteTo(new StringWriter(), RenderSection(&quot;intellisense&quot;, required: false));}</pre>

<p>That is <em>just enough</em> to get it to work properly and display the IntelliSense as desired.</p>

<p>I am still looking for a way to get this to happen automatically, but for now, placing the <code>@section intellisense</code> region at the top of each view will have to do.</p>
